/*	A C version of Kahan's Floating Point Test "Paranoia"

			Thos Sumner, UCSF, Feb. 1985
			David Gay, BTL, Jan. 1986

	This is a rewrite from the Pascal version by

			B. A. Wichmann, 18 Jan. 1985

	(and does NOT exhibit good C programming style).

	Adjusted to use Standard C headers 19 Jan. 1992 (dmg);
	compile with -DKR_headers or insert
#define KR_headers
	at the beginning if you have an old-style C compiler.

(C) Apr 19 1983 in BASIC version by:
	Professor W. M. Kahan,
	567 Evans Hall
	Electrical Engineering & Computer Science Dept.
	University of California
	Berkeley, California 94720
	USA

converted to Pascal by:
	B. A. Wichmann
	National Physical Laboratory
	Teddington Middx
	TW11 OLW
	UK

converted to C by:

	David M. Gay		and	Thos Sumner
	AT&T Bell Labs			Computer Center, Rm. U-76

with simultaneous corrections to the Pascal source (reflected
in the Pascal source available over netlib).
[A couple of bug fixes from dgh = sun!dhough incorporated 31 July 1986.]

Reports of results on various systems from all the versions
of Paranoia are being collected by Richard Karpinski at the
same address as Thos Sumner.  This includes sample outputs,
bug reports, and criticisms.

You may copy this program freely if you acknowledge its source.
Comments on the Pascal version to NPL, please.


The C version catches signals from floating-point exceptions.
If signal(SIGFPE,...) is unavailable in your environment, you may
#define NOSIGNAL to comment out the invocations of signal.

This source file is too big for some C compilers, but may be split
into pieces.  Comments containing "SPLIT" suggest convenient places
for this splitting.  At the end of these comments is an "ed script"
(for the UNIX(tm) editor ed) that will do this splitting.

By #defining Single when you compile this source, you may obtain
a single-precision C version of Paranoia.


The following is from the introductory commentary from Wichmann's work:

The BASIC program of Kahan is written in Microsoft BASIC using many
facilities which have no exact analogy in Pascal.  The Pascal
version below cannot therefore be exactly the same.  Rather than be
a minimal transcription of the BASIC program, the Pascal coding
follows the conventional style of block-structured languages.  Hence
the Pascal version could be useful in producing versions in other
structured languages.

Rather than use identifiers of minimal length (which therefore have
little mnemonic significance), the Pascal version uses meaningful
identifiers as follows [Note: A few changes have been made for C]:

All the variables in BASIC are true variables and in consequence,
the program is more difficult to follow since the "constants" must
be determined (the glossary is very helpful).  The Pascal version
uses Real constants, but checks are added to ensure that the values
are correctly converted by the compiler.

The major textual change to the Pascal version apart from the
identifiersis that named procedures are used, inserting parameters
wherehelpful.  New procedures are also introduced.  The
correspondence is as follows:

  90- 140   Pause
 170- 250   Instructions

of the form part[1-8].c, subs.c, and msgs.c, plus a header
